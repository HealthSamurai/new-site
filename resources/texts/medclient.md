## Physician Documentation

Physicians enter notes directly into the Choice-HS EHR via the keyboard, voice recognition, or dictate into the system which integrates transcription features Physicians can easily record patient problems, enter medication orders based on the latest formulary, and order lab tests and other departmental services. They see drug and allergy alerts immediately. Time-consuming tasks related to medication reconciliation, patient instructions and education materials, and discharge notes are streamlined by pulling in data from the entire Choice-HS patient record.
Smart Elements embed related clinical information into the appropriate documentation, reducing the time required for physicians to complete and sign notes. Because the entire Choice-HS EHR is available on their iPads, physicians can sign discharge orders and summaries conveniently and securely from any location.
Workflow logic incorporates information from earlier encounters, reducing needless searching for important patient information, and ensuring that clinical decisions are based on a complete view of the patient’s historythat clinical decisions are based on a complete view of the patient’s history

Smart Elements can be shared across specialties, or with other individual physicians, maximizing the benefits of standardized care throughout the facility.

Nursing documentation
Nursing tasks are fully automated in the Choice HS EHR – triage, assessment, charting allergies, vitals, I&O, and documentation such as 24 hour flow sheets and discharge plans. These routine activities are pre-populated with required fields and compliance logic. Nurses and physicians view the electronic chart with full nursing documentation and integrated data from existing systems immediately – i.e., lab results, medications, clinical history. .
Nursing workflows can be customized to reflect existing processes so your busy nursing staff doesn’t have to change how they take care of patients. Built-in compliance ensures complete and accurate documentation.

Choice-HS is not just "easy to use", but also easy to learn, and integrate into clinicians’ workflows. The familiar user interface makes the difference.

Smart Elements prevent duplicate entries and ensure that information is presented at the appropriate time, to the appropriate user, in the right context.
Smart Elements track clinicians’ work, showing completed steps with a clear visual indicator, and automatically taking the user to the appropriate next step.
