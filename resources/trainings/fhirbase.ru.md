While crafting Health IT systems we understand an importance 
of a properly chosen domain model. 
FHIR is an open source new generation lightweight standard for health data interoperability, 
which (we hope) could be used as a foundation for Health IT systems. 
FHIR is based on a concept of resource.

FHIR® is a next generation standards framework created by HL7®. 
FHIR combines the best features of HL7 Version 2, Version 3 and CDA® product lines while leveraging the latest web standards and applying a tight focus on implementability.
Also we learned that data is a heart of any information system, 
and should be reliably managed. 

PostgreSQL is a battle proved open source database which supports structured documents (jsonb) while preserving ACID guaranties 
and richness of SQL query language.
